1\. Compatibility check - Check whether the app is compatible with current and old versions of the OS (Given that it is on an android: compatibility with different Android Interfaces)

2\. Testing of main functionalities: Adding an expense - Adding income - Calculations are done correctly

3\. Testing of additional functionalities: Transfer from account to account - adding/removing an account

4\. Testing of further additional functionalities: Adding/removing categories - Changing icons - filtering transactions

UX Recommendation:

1\. Icons move from their place after every transaction which may be misleading to what a user might be acustomed to when adding their expenses

2\. Add Label is misleading: there is a label named "add" that misleads the user to tapping it to add the category

3\. Top left of the app landing page shows which account you're on, but it is not clickable. Would be great to tap it then be able to switch between accounts through it
